                    <p><H5>Update: Matthew Povey,12th January 2025.</H5>
                    </p><p>
                        I built the original <a href="https://podsearch.kyomu.org">Rest Is History Interrogator</a> in 2023, 
                        it was partly an experiment to see how effective code generation could be in building hobby projects. It proved 
                        very effective but the original version ended up being a bit of a mess and hard to maintain. I built simple AI functionality into that
                        version but didn't release it because the API costs at the time were too high to justify. Since then, the cost of AI inference has fallen 
                        dramatically to the point where it's reasonable to make the functionality available. It's still a fairly naive RAG implementation but works well enough. 
                    </p><p>         
                        This version is a mostly complete rewrite of the original and a demonstration of how much easier it is to build applications with the tools
                        that are now available. Code generation is now sufficiently effective that large parts of application functionality can be built 
                        without writing any code at all. Indeed, there are parts of the application code that I've barely even looked at. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are very nearly at the point where any individual can build tools which make their lives or jobs easier which is a very exciting prospect.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved the semantic search by moving from a flat file vector store to ChromaDB</li>
                        <li>Finally added the ability to ask questions with AI. I use <a href="{{ provider_url }}">{{ provider_name }}</a> to get high speed inference</li>
                        <li>Re-ran transcriptions using a newer version of OpenAI Whisper (much faster as I now have better hardware)</li>
                        <li>Moved from whoosh to ElasticSearch for the free text search</li>
                        <li>Added a simple chat interface</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><h5>Still to come (maybe, when I have time)</h5></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Re-process the transcripts to clean up proper nouns that Whisper gets wrong</li>
                        <li>Diarized transcripts to properly distinguish between Dom, Tom and guests</li>
                        <li>A more comprehensive database of episodes and a way to search it</li>
                    </ul>
                     
                    <p><h3>About page from the March 2023 version:</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjp/">Matthew</a>. Like many others, podcasts have mostly replaced the radio as the primary 
                        way I listen to audio for entertainment, professional information and news.There are a few podcasts, including The Rest is History for 
                        which I have listened to many if not all episodes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some, like <a href="https://www.econtalk.org/">EconTalk</a> have transcripts available to read and search, 
                        but most do not. This makes discovering whether someone said what you think they did or told a story the way you remember it difficult. 
                        Building a searchable database of transcripts of any podcast I might fancy has long been a back-burner project which, like 
                        most of my back-burner projects I didn't have any real expectation of doing. It's not that I couldn't do it, but that the knowledge
                        I would need to acquire to do it wasn't all that useful to me outside of the specific project and so the investment of time was difficult to justify.</p>
                        <p>That changed when large language models (LLMs) started to become effective ways to help build - or just build - code. The project became 
                            more managable still when OpenAI released their <a href="https://openai.com/research/whisper">Whisper</a> project which offered the ability
                            to do high-quality transcriptions of any audio in many languages on consumer grade computer hardware. Then <a href="https://twitter.com/ggerganov">Georgi Gerganov</a> worked minor 
                            miracles to port that to C++ dramatically increasing the performance and hence reducing the compute and time required to transcribe. His 
                            <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp">whisper.cpp</a> project meant I could get 400 episodes of The Rest is History transcribed
                            using 3 computers (an old i7 server, an i5 Mac Mini and a M1 Macbook Air) in my house over about 72 hours. As this was winter, I even got to 
                            keep my office warm by doing it...
                            </p>
                        <p>The combination of Whisper.cpp, GitHub CoPilot and the original ChatGPT got the first version of the application built much faster that I 
                            could have done it myself and without having to spend money on transcription services from Google GCP or Amazon AWS. With the launch of GPT4
                            it's even easier to get write code that works well enough to be useful. Anyone with experience building web-based applications professionally
                            will notice all the signs that I don't do that in the quality of the HTML. </p>
                        <p>I've now added some further functionality to complement the simple search functionality. I've used the OpenAI embeddings service to create a better
                            (or different at any rate) version of the search which allows for more free-form (semantic in the industry jargon) searches. The original would find
                            nothing for a search of <b>"the wrong shoes affecting global politics"</b> or <b>"Cromwell's behaviour in Ireland"</b> but the new version does. 
                            While this is an improvement, it's really just the groundwork to allow a LLM to search the podcast and answer questions about it. That already works
                            rather well but I need to figure out how to avoid it costing me a fortune.</p> 
                            <p>This whole thing has been a bit of fun and an experiment is learning how much a below average developer can get done using the tools that are now
                            available to us. I hope you find it useful.</p>
